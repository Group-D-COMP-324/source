            <h4>Two Player Login</h4>
            <p>Connect four is a two player game, where each player tries to build their lines of four. This can be done horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Each player will drop in one checker piece of his color one at a time. This will give you a chance
                to either build your row, or stop your opponent from getting four in a row.</p>

            <h4>Single Player Login</h4>
            <p>One single player can login and play against a friend using the same computer under local play. The rules and pattern of the game are still the same as though two players logged in to play.</p>

            <h4>Gameover</h4>
            <p>The game is over when you have the first player to align four chips wins. All you have to do is connect four of your colored checker pieces in a row.<br>The game is also over when no player is able to align four chips and all forty-two (42)
                slots are filled, ending in a stalemate.</p>

            <h4>Registration</h4>
